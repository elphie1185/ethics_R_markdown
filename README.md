# How can we make deep learning more transparent?


## Project Scope
Data ethics project - using R markdown and CSS
This project involved answering the ethical questions: "How can we make deep learning more transparent?" 
The results were presented using R markdown in one of the inbuilt slide presentation format. 
The slides were personalised with CSS.


### Introduction
The first step of the project was to generate a template presentation using R markdown and personalise the slides using CSS. 
The template chosen is shown below:

### Definitions
I then moved onto explaining what deep learning was using the example of speech recognition. How speech recognition is an exellent concept, particularly useful but how it is far from a perfect technology and how it can fail.

The complexity of deep learning algorithms and neural network was highlighted by comparing the simplicity of a logistic regression against the neural net.
